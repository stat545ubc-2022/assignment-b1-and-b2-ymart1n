The goal of countNA is to count missing values (NA) in the specified column `col_name` of the given data set `data`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of countNA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-ymart1n")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to count missing values (NA) in columns `sex` and `year` of the data set `penguins`:

```{r example}
library(countNA)
## penguins is a data set from palmerpenguins that has columns "sex" and "year" 
library(palmerpenguins)
count_na(penguins, "sex")
count_na(penguins, "year")
```
